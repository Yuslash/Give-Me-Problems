# num = 10
# print(num > 5 and num < 15) # both needs to be true 
# print(num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0) # if any one true then ok 
# print(not (num == 0)) # even if it false then it will be true

# ths is and operator
# a = 2
# b = 3
# print(a & b)

# this is or operator 
# a = 2
# b = 3
# print(a | b)

# this is XOR operator
